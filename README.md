# Car-Drawing

This project uses Python's `matplotlib` to draw a car in a beautiful scenic landscape. The scene includes mountains, a sun, trees, clouds, and a car driving across a green field, all rendered using simple geometric shapes and patches.

## Features

- **Sky**: A clear, blue sky.
- **Sun**: A bright, yellow sun shining in the upper corner.
- **Mountains**: Three large mountains drawn with polygons to provide a scenic backdrop.
- **Clouds**: Fluffy white clouds made from groups of circles.
- **Car**: A red car with a body, roof, windows, and wheels.
- **Tree**: A tree with a brown trunk and green leaves on the side of the scene.
- **Ground**: A green field that the car is driving on.
